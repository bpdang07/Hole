# Hole
Converting SVG into a STL. Still a work in progress but, device using Golang, to convert multiple objects into newere coding segments.

Right now im able to turn any amount lines i can only make STL's. So if I ask it to turn into a 3D shape with a hole. Like for an example if I ask my for 3 lines it will create an triangle, an turn it a 3D. Right there is no good menu but it still can do it if i change a variable in the code.
